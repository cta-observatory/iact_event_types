Before trying to execute the notebooks, you will need some eventDisplay input files. These are root files containing DL2 information from the eventDisplay analysis done by Gernot Maire at DESY.

A description of their content and links to download them can be found here:

The easiest way to download them is here:
* https://ccdcacli236.in2p3.fr:2880/vo.cta.in2p3.fr/MC/PROD3/DL2_evndisp/Paranal_20deg/
* https://ccdcacli236.in2p3.fr:2880/vo.cta.in2p3.fr/MC/PROD3/DL2_evndisp/LaPalma_20deg/

Once you download some gamma root files, you can start playing around with the 2 notebooks.
